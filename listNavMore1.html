      <h3>Consider This</h3>
      <p>Before you panic, media queries don't have to be overwhelming if you start simple and keep some important tips in mind. </p>
      <h4>Very Basic Media Terminology</h4>
      <p><strong>REPONSIVE DESIGN</strong> - The position and size of the elements on the page change to suit the viewport size and orientation.</p>
      <p><strong>MEDIA QUERY</strong> - Media query is a technique introduced in CSS3 that uses a media rule to identify a block of CSS properties that will be used only if a certain condition or conditions are true.</p>
      <p><strong>BREAKPOINT</strong> - the identified point at which a media query starts or ends. Often represented by minimum width in pixels or maximum width in pixels.</p>
      <p><strong>VIEWPORT</strong> - The viewport is the visible area of a webpage, and it varies by device and screen size.</p>
      <p><strong>MEDIA RULE</strong> - A media rule holds within brackets all of the style rules that relate to the specific condition being met. In the case of a simple media query for a mobile first website, it will likely be defined by a minimum or a maximum width. </p>
      <h4>Device Dilemna</h4>
      <p>No device dilemna needed. Don't think about devices when determining your media queries, instead make your page look good as it goes from a small width to a large width. Eventually, some of your breakpoints will do a little, and some will do a lot.</p>

    <h3>Bits </h3>
    <p><strong>Line height</strong> defines the total height of the line box. Called leading in typographical terms, we set line-height with a unitless number. If we set line-height at 1.5, that means 1.5 times the current font size. In CSS, leading is applied to the top and the bottom of the line boxes. If the font is default 16px/1rem and the line-height is 1.5 (24px) 24-26=8/2=4 so 4px or .25rem applied to top and bottom. Line height for responsive averages 1.5 for desktop and 1.3 for the smallest screens.</p>
    <p>Add <strong>box-sizing: border-box </strong>declaration globally to keep you from having to worry about the box model.</p>
    <p>Setting up your basic<strong> viewport meta data</strong> in the head helps control the scale in portrait or landscape.</p>
    <p> Language of your page. Add <strong>lang ="en"</strong> to your html opening tag.</p>
    <p><strong>display:inline-block</strong> takes advantage of both inline and block. With just the inline, you get the horizontal display and you can add horizontal margins, paddings and borders, but adding vertical margins, padding, borders and widths or heights will do nada. You need inline block for all that tweaking ability. </p>

    <h3>Step by Step Basic Media Query</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Design mobile first</li>
      <li>Determine the differences needed for a media query.</li>
      <li>Create a media query with a minimum width.</li>
      <li>Create style rules that include only the differences.
        <ol>
          <li>Your global styles should ideally consider mobile first. Think simple, everything including navigation can go the full width, and flow one thing after another in logical order. <a href="listNavMore1.html" title="Mobile First One" target="_blank">Example page one</a></li>
          <li>At the bottom of your global styles, add a media query [ @media (min-width: px) {} ] with a minimum width that will look good with your content and navigation. Add style rules only for what needs to change. <a href="listNavMore1a.html" title="add media query with a minimum width" target="_blank">Example page two</a></li>
          <li>Now your navigation needs to be addressed. Inline block and widths for list elements is generally an easy solution. One helpful trick to making inline block navigation behave is to zero out the font size at ul, the level above list, or if you don't have a list, at the level above a or nav. Then in the li or if you don't have a list at the a, add the font-size back. This will take away the spaces between inline block elements <a href="listNavMore1b.html" title="Space between inline block elements trick" target="_blank">Example page three</a>.</li>
          <li>One of the differences might be elements that will be side by side in larger viewports. You'll need to add widths to those components appropriately, but don't add more than just what needs to change. The main and aside sections that were 100% width in mobile view will be 40% and 60% for this page. <a href="listNavMore1c.html" title="Adding widths for side by side sections" target="_blank">Example page four.</a> </li>
          <li>Finally, add the appropriate float and don't forget to clear so that your footer will stay in place. <a href="listNavMore2.html" title="Add Float and Clear if necessary." target="_blank">Example page five.</a> </li>
		  </ol></li>
      <li>Be sure all media query styles are inside the media query brackets.</li>
    </ol>
